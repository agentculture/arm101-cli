"""Regression guard for issue #33 — abnormal-exit torque leak (task t1).

``arm explore`` died on an unhandled ``serial.SerialException`` mid-run and
left ALL SIX MOTORS ENERGIZED, holding against gravity at ~50C with nobody
watching. ``gentle_move`` deliberately holds torque on a clean finish or a
detected contact — stop-and-hold is its contract and is CORRECT (see
:mod:`arm101.hardware.gentle`). The gap is at the CLI VERB level: neither
``cmd_arm_flex`` nor ``cmd_arm_explore`` (see ``arm101/cli/_commands/arm.py``)
does anything but ``bus.close()`` in their ``finally`` — and closing the bus
does not touch torque — so ANY abnormal exit (an unhandled exception, a bus
fault, SIGINT) walks away from a powered arm.

These tests were written (task t1) against the DEFECT, marked
``xfail(strict=True)``, before any fix existed. Task t2 built the
:func:`~arm101.hardware.safety.torque_guard` primitive and task t3 wired it into
every gated motion verb; the markers came off with t3, which is what strict xfail
is for — an unexpected pass is a hard failure, so the fix cannot land while
leaving a stale xfail behind. Every test below asserts the post-fix behavior:
torque disabled on every motor after an abnormal exit.

Scenarios covered (each fails differently, so each gets its own test):

(a) an arbitrary (non-``CliError``, non-``OverloadError``) exception raised
    mid-run from a bus read — standing in for the ``serial.SerialException``
    that actually killed ``arm explore`` on hardware;
(b) a ``KeyboardInterrupt`` (SIGINT) mid-run — ``main()``'s dispatcher only
    catches ``CliError``/``Exception`` (see ``arm101/cli/__init__.py``
    ``_dispatch``), so a ``KeyboardInterrupt`` is a ``BaseException`` that
    is deliberately never swallowed there; any safety net has to run before
    it escapes, not rely on the top-level dispatcher catching it;
(c) a bus fault raised from the RELEASE path itself — the bus that just threw
    the original fault is the same bus any recovery must reuse, and on real
    hardware that release write can fail too (comms are already unhappy).
    One motor's release failing must not stop the rest from being released.

Bus injection seam mirrors tests/test_arm_overload.py: ``arm_cmd._open_bus``
is monkeypatched to hand back a purpose-built :class:`~arm101.hardware.bus.FakeBus`
subclass, driven through the real CLI entry point (:func:`arm101.cli.main`)
rather than a bare handler call, so the test exercises the verb-level gap.
